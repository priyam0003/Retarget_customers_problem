# Retarget_customers_problem

The data results from an advertising campaign of a large travel agency.
We have access to two datasets

Adandoned.csv (ABD)
Reservation.csv (RES)

The first contains demographic information about customers who engaged with the travel agency, but that did not buy a vacation package. You may notice the sparseness/missingness of the data and also the presence of potential duplicates.
These customers were randomly assigned to a retargeting campaign; you can see their status in the “Test_Control” column.
Sometime later, data about reservations were pulled from the system, so have obtained the “Reservation.csv” File. Note that you will just see those who bought a package, whether in the treatment or control group, or neither.

We are generally tasked with matching the data across the files to test whether the retargeting campaign has worked statistically.
